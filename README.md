# Unit-4-game
This is our unit 4 game assignment. 
This game uses what we have learned with jQuery and Javascript also incorporating html and css.
I have linked this game to my bootstrap portfolio as well.

You will be given a random number at the start of the game 
There are four beautiful bikes for collecting below. By clicking on a bike you will add a specific amount of point to your total score. 
You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. 
The value of each bike is hidden from you until you click on it. 
Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each bike.
